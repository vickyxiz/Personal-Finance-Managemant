# Personal-Finance-Managemant
The Personal Finance Manager is a Java-based application designed to help users track their income and expenses efficiently. It allows users to record financial transactions and categorize them for better budget management. The application saves transaction data in a text file to ensure persistence across sessions. With a simple console-based interface, it provides an easy way to monitor financial health. Users can review their income, expenses, and overall balance at any time. Users can categorize expenses under predefined sections like Salary, Food, and Entertainment. The tool also helps prevent overspending by validating expenses against total income. Being Java-based, it is platform-independent and requires minimal setup.
